 * current execution's `Scope` (via {@link makeExecutionMemo}), so the
 * `D1Client` (and its prepared-statement cache) is built at most once per
 * execution — a Worker `fetch`/`queue`/`scheduled` event, a Durable Object
 * call, or a Workflow run — and torn down when the event settles. Deploy /
 * plan-time invocations never touch D1.

/**
 * Bind a Prisma Object Store {@link Bucket} to a Prisma Compute app, AWS
 * Lambda Function, or Cloudflare Worker with write access, and obtain the
 * typed runtime client.
 *
 * Binding creates a `Prisma.BucketAccessKey` for the bucket and carries its S3
 * credentials into the host environment, so the caller never handles a
 * credential themselves.
 *
 * Provide {@link WriteBucketBinding} on the host implementation.
 *
 * **Role caveat.** Prisma bucket keys carry one of two coarse roles, `read`
 * and `read_write`; there is no write-only role. This binding therefore mints
 * a `read_write` key, and the credential it puts in the host environment can
 * also read. The write-only contract is enforced client-side —
 * {@link WriteBucketClient} exposes no read operations — and becomes a
 * server-side boundary if Prisma grows a write-only role.
 *
 * ### Binding a Bucket
 * **Example:** Write objects from Prisma Compute
 * ```typescript
 * export default Prisma.Compute(
 *   "api",
 *   { project, main: import.meta.filename },
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const uploads = yield* Prisma.WriteBucket(bucket);
 *
 *     return {
 *       fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *         yield* uploads.put("reports/2026.json", JSON.stringify({ ok: true }), {
 *           contentType: "application/json",
 *         });
 *         return yield* HttpServerResponse.empty({ status: 204 });
 *       }),
 *     };
 *   }).pipe(Effect.provide(Prisma.WriteBucketBinding)),
 * );
 * ```
 *

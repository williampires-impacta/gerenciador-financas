/**
 * Shared HTTP scaffolding for the Amazon Q Apps runtime bindings.
 *
 * NOT exported from `index.ts` — every `{Op}Http.ts` in this service is a
 * thin `Layer.effect(Cap, make…HttpBinding({ … }))` over one of the builders
 * below. Everything except the operation and the IAM action list is
 * boilerplate: every Q Apps operation runs against the Q Business
 * application environment instance of the bound {@link QApp} (its
 * `instanceId` is injected as the `instance-id` header), and app-keyed
 * operations additionally inject the bound app's `appId`.
 *
 * Two IAM grant shapes:
 *
 * - {@link makeQAppHttpBinding} — operations keyed by the bound Q App or one
 *   of its sessions. Granted on the app's ARN and its sub-resources
 *   (`{appArn}`, `{appArn}/*` — Q App session ARNs are children of the app
 *   ARN).
 * - {@link makeQAppsInstanceHttpBinding} — instance-level operations
 *   (library items, categories, listing, generation). Library-item and
 *   category authorization ARNs are service-assigned and not derivable from
 *   a bound Q App, so these grant on `Resource: ["*"]`.
 */

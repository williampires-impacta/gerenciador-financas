 * NOT exported from `index.ts` — every `{Op}Http.ts` in this service is a
 * thin `Layer.effect(Cap, make…HttpBinding({ … }))` over one of the two
 * builders below. Everything except the operation and the IAM action list is
 * boilerplate: every Kendra data-plane operation is scoped to one index
 * (whose id is injected as `IndexId` and whose ARN receives the grant), and
 * the sync-job operations are additionally scoped to one data source (whose
 * id is injected as `Id` and whose ARN receives the grant alongside its
 * parent index's).

 * Build the impl Effect for an index-scoped Kendra operation (query,
 * retrieve, document batches, principal mapping, suggestions config, …): the
 * runtime callable injects the bound {@link Index}'s id as `IndexId` and the
 * deploy-time half grants `actions` on the index ARN (plus any
 * `subResources` suffix patterns, e.g. `data-source/*` for the
 * principal-mapping operations that also act on data-source-scoped groups).
 *
 * `prepare` (optional) maps a friendlier public request shape onto the wire
 * request — e.g. `UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig` converts a `Duration.Input`
 * into the wire `QueryLogLookBackWindowInDays`. It defaults to identity.

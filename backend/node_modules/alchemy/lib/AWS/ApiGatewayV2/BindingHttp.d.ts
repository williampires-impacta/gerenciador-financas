 * Shared HTTP-binding scaffolding for the ApiGatewayV2 capabilities

 *
 * NOT exported from `index.ts` — this is internal plumbing, like
 * Cloudflare's `BucketHttp.ts`.
 *
 * API Gateway's control plane (v2 included) authorizes by HTTP verb
 * (`apigateway:GET`, `apigateway:DELETE`, …) against path-shaped ARNs
 * (`arn:aws:apigateway:{region}::/apis/{apiId}/exports/{specification}`),
 * so every capability reduces to { verb, ARN paths, operation }.
 * Everything else — the runtime guard, host resolution, region lookup,
 * and the `host.bind` policy registration — is identical and lives here.
 *
 * The `@connections` data plane (`execute-api:ManageConnections`) is the
 * one genuinely different capability and stays bespoke in
 * `ManageConnectionsHttp.ts`.

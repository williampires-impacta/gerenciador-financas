 * service is a thin `Layer.effect(Cap, makeBucketHttpBinding({ … }))` over
 * this builder. Everything except the operation, the IAM action(s), and the
 * IAM resource shape is boilerplate:
 *
 * - the deploy-time half registers `Allow(host, tag(bucket))` with the
 *   requested actions on the bound bucket (object-level `${arn}/*` or the
 *   bucket ARN itself, per `iamResources`);
 * - the runtime callable injects the resolved bucket name as `Bucket`.
 *
 * Genuinely-different bindings stay bespoke: `PresignGetObject` /
 * `PresignPutObject` (SigV4 presigners, not API operations).

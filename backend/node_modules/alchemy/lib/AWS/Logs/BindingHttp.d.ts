 * this builder. Everything except the operation, the IAM action(s), and the
 * IAM resource shape is boilerplate:
 *
 * - the deploy-time half registers `Allow(host, tag(logGroup))` with the
 *   requested actions on the bound group's ARN (and/or its `:*` log-stream
 *   wildcard, per `iamResources`);
 * - the runtime callable injects the resolved `logGroupName` into the request
 *   (unless `injectLogGroupName: false` — for query-id / record-pointer
 *   scoped operations like `GetQueryResults`, `StopQuery`, `GetLogRecord`).
 *
 * Genuinely-different bindings stay bespoke: `LogEventSink` (a batching sink
 * over the `PutLogEvents` capability).

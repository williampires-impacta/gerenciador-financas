/**
 * Shared HTTP scaffolding for the AWS Organizations runtime bindings.
 *
 * Organizations is a management-account-scoped global service: every runtime
 * operation targets the caller's organization or entities within it (roots,
 * OUs, accounts, policies, handshakes) that are chosen per request at
 * runtime, so every binding is account-level and grants its action(s) on
 * `Resource: ["*"]`.
 *
 * NOT exported from `index.ts` — every thin `{Op}Http.ts` in this service is
 * a `Layer.effect(Cap, makeOrganizationsHttpBinding({ … }))` over the builder
 * below. Everything except the operation and the IAM action list is
 * boilerplate.

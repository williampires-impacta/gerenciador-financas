/**
 * Shared scaffolding for CloudWatch HTTP bindings.
 *
 * NOT exported from `index.ts` — every single-operation `{Op}Http.ts` in
 * this service is a thin `Layer.effect(Cap, make…HttpBinding({ … }))` over
 * one of the three builders below. Everything except the operation, the IAM
 * action, and the injected identifier(s) is boilerplate:
 *
 * - {@link makeCloudWatchAccountHttpBinding} — account-level operations
 *   (`PutMetricData`, `GetMetricData`, `List*`, account-wide `Describe*`).
 *   CloudWatch metric-data and account-wide describe/list actions do not
 *   support resource-level permissions, so the deploy-time half grants
 *   `actions` on `*`.
 * - {@link makeCloudWatchResourceHttpBinding} — operations scoped to one
 *   bound resource (`GetDashboard`, `SetAlarmState`, `GetMetricStream`, …).
 *   The runtime callable injects the resource's identifier under
 *   `requestKey`; the deploy-time half grants `actions` on the resource ARN.
 * - {@link makeCloudWatchResourceSetHttpBinding} — batch toggles over a
 *   variadic set of bound resources (`EnableAlarmActions`,
 *   `DisableInsightRules`, `StartMetricStreams`, …). The runtime callable
 *   takes no request and injects the sorted resource names under `namesKey`;
 *   the deploy-time half grants `action` on every resource ARN.
 *
 * Genuinely-different bindings stay bespoke: `DescribeAlarms` (computes
 * `AlarmTypes` from the bound alarm set and accepts a filter request) and
 * `MetricSink` (a batching sink over the `PutMetricData` capability).

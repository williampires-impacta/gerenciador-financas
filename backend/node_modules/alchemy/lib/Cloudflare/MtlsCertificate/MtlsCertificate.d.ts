/**
 * An account-level Cloudflare mTLS certificate.
 *
 * Uploads a certificate to the account-level mTLS certificate store. Upload a
 * CA certificate (`ca: true`) to validate client certificates (referenced by
 * certificate-authority hostname associations and Hyperdrive
 * `caCertificateId`), or a leaf certificate plus private key (`ca: false`)
 * that Cloudflare presents to your origin (referenced by Worker
 * `mtls_certificate` bindings and Hyperdrive `mtlsCertificateId`).
 *
 * Certificates are immutable: there is no update API, so changing any
 * property triggers a replacement.
 * ### Uploading Certificates
 * **Example:** CA certificate
 * ```typescript
 * const ca = yield* Cloudflare.MtlsCertificate.MtlsCertificate("client-ca", {
 *   ca: true,
 *   certificates: caPem,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * **Example:** Leaf certificate with private key
 * ```typescript
 * const cert = yield* Cloudflare.MtlsCertificate.MtlsCertificate("origin-client-cert", {
 *   ca: false,
 *   certificates: leafPem,
 *   privateKey: yield* Config.redacted("ORIGIN_CLIENT_KEY"),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * **Example:** Named certificate
 * ```typescript
 * const ca = yield* Cloudflare.MtlsCertificate.MtlsCertificate("client-ca", {
 *   name: "my-client-ca",
 *   ca: true,
 *   certificates: caPem,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Referencing from Hyperdrive
 * **Example:** Verify the origin with an uploaded CA
 * ```typescript
 * const ca = yield* Cloudflare.MtlsCertificate.MtlsCertificate("db-ca", {
 *   ca: true,
 *   certificates: caPem,
 * });
 *
 * const hd = yield* Cloudflare.Hyperdrive.Connection("my-db", {
 *   origin: { ... },
 *   mtls: {
 *     caCertificateId: ca.mtlsCertificateId,
 *     sslmode: "verify-full",
 *   },
 * });
 * ```

 * Wrap a Cloudflare service-binding stub (or an `Effect` that resolves

 * `WorkerEnvironment` that's only available at *exec* phase) into an
 * Effect-typed RPC client.
 *
 * `Service.fetch`/`Service.connect` are passed through eagerly when the
 * stub is already resolved; everything else is treated as an RPC method
 * whose dispatch is deferred until call time, so the user effect runs in
 * the right runtime layer (which is what `bindWorker` actually wants —
 * its methods are called at exec, even though it's *defined* at init).
